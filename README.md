# About the Project

My project is a simple Quiz App designed to challenge and test your knowledge, either alone or with friends.

To start the game, you need to enter your name and choose a category. Additionally, if you do not provide a name, your data will not be saved in the leaderboard. Once you have answered all the questions, you will be directed to a <FinalPage /> that displays your results. From there, you can view the <LeaderBoard />. And also you can go back to <Homepage />.
